# Data-Analysis-Using-Excel
This is an academic project that I did as part of my Data Analysis course at the University of Cincinnati. I chose the census data of India as my dataset and built an analysis using Microsoft Excel. This repository contains the dataset, the excel analysis file as well as a project report.
